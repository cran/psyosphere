Description: Analyse location data such as latitude,
    longitude, and elevation. Based on spherical trigonometry, variables such as
    speed, bearing, and distances can be calculated from moment to moment, 
    depending on the sampling frequency of the equipment used, and independent 
    of scale. Additionally, the package can plot tracks, coordinates, and shapes
    on maps, and sub-tracks can be selected with point-in-polygon or other 
    techniques. The package is optimized to support behavioural science 
    experiments with multiple tracks. It can detect and clean up errors in the 
    data, and resulting data can be exported to be analysed in statistical 
    software or geographic information systems (GIS).
